animal = "Lion" # added ""   
animal_type = "cub"
number_of_teeth = "16"  #"" added

full_spec = f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth."  # added f to create an fstring and changed the order of the variables so it made sense


print (full_spec)   # added () = this was a syntax error due to missing perentetise
